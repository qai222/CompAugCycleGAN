"""
this package is nxviz==0.3.7 developed by Eric Ma
repo: https://github.com/ericmjl/nxviz
doc: https://nxviz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

I use this package to plot the bipartite graph as a Circos plot between amine and chemical systems in ATMOs
unfortunately the latest version (0.7.3) has this function deprecated,
and the old version (0.3.7 - py3.6) that supports this function has dependencies conflicting with cacgan environment
so I copied the old version here and made a few modifications so it work with cacgan env
