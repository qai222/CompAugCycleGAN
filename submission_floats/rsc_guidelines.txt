Colour images may be used free of charge both online and in print (we use CMYK colour model)

Figures, Schemes and Charts should be supplied as TIFF files, with a resolution of 600 dpi or greater.
 You can supply EPS or PDF files instead, but we will need to convert these to TIFF files in the final article

Images should fit within either single column (8.3 cm) or double column (17.1 cm) width, and must be no longer than 23.3 cm.
They should be prepared to make best use of the space available and must not be larger than a single page

Any text, numerical data or scale bars should be clearly legible and sized appropriately so that any data may be accurately interpreted

Figures including logos, trademarks or brands names (for example Lego® or Rubik’s Cube®) should not be used.
 You must obtain permission to use any figure or graphic belonging to someone else;
